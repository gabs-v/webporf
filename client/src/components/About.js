            <p>
                As a full stack software engineer, I have a passion for developing 
                both secure and efficient back-ends, as well eye-catching and responsive 
                front-end user interfaces. Since starting my development journey in 2020, 
                I have been able to highlight skill sets of mine such as problem-solving, 
                teamwork, critical thinking, communication, creativity and an
                overall eagerness to learn.
            </p>

                When I'm not developing, you can catch me in the kitchen cooking anything 
                from hispanic comfort food I was raised on, to some new and exciting recipe.
                You can also find me enjoying the company of my favorite 
                people and pets.
