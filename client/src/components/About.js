                The start of my web development journey started soon after I started college
                in the fall of 2019. At the time I was studying primary education. Was I super passionate with it?
                Not really, but teaching tiny kids their ABC's and 123's seemed like a pretty stable gig.
                <br/>That was until during one of my late night study sessions I found 
                a Youtube video that was introducing the basics of HTML. As someone who was 
                on their 12th "study break" of the night, this really caught my eye. Just like that, 
                I was hooked.

                After work and school I would practice the basics.
                Slowly throughout the next year continue to code HTML and CSS 
                whilst still going to school for primary education and working full time. There wasn't much
                time to practice but boy, I sure did make time to at least play around with it some. It wasn't until
                late 2020 where I really craved some more structure when it came to my code. I toyed with the
                idea of switching majors. That was until, after seeing a few different ads, where I decided to take a 
                sharp turn and drop out to enroll into a coding bootcamp 
            </p>
